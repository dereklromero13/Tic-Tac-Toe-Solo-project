##Progression

### Iteration 0 - Setup and Webpage layout

4/16/20: Set up repo, created a project planner in GitHub, and created slack channel page for the project. Planned out a
wire-framing sheet to get the overall HTML down into a diagram so I could begin the see the general skeleton of the project.
Labeled the appropriate elements within the wire-framing so that I could quickly write the code that was needed.


4/17-18/20: On these two days I really spent time making sure I had a clear understanding Of the processes that I was trying
tho get across and the next steps that needed to be taken. I started with the HTML and really tried to make the elements as specific
as I could. The wire-framing I created on the first dat really helped me structure the HTML to my liking. Although I know I will still need
incorporate some aspects of the HTML I believe I have a solid structure to work with. The CSS was also created on these days which was
a bit experimental as we could make the board any way we saw fit. Using short hand to clean up the code and using grid for the first time
really added some experience to layouts in general.
